# for-loop:
# for loop executes the set of statements with repeat to every elemnet of the string/ collection objects
x=[10,20,30,40]
print(x)

# Syntax: for variable name in sequence:(list,set,tuple)
x=[10,20,30,40,50]
for i in x:
    print(i)
 # in while we are using condition coming to for we cannot use the condition to print the elements in the list one by one
 # for suppose list is not there we have to print first ten natural numbers.
 # now we are using range()
 # syntax of range: range( start value, stop value, step value)

 # for example range(10)  in this one we cannnot give start value and step value , we give only stop value, then 
 # by default  it will take start value as  zero  and step value by default 1.
