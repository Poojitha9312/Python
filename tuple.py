# tuple is an  inbuild datastructure in python..It is similar to list data structure but the main difference is 
# tuple is immutable in nature while list is mutable in nature........
# tuple is immutable in nature once we create tuple object we cannot made any modifications on it...
# () paranthesis symbol is used to create tuple...


# creation of empty tuple():
t=()
print(t)
print(type(t))


# creation of tuple with single value:
t=(10)
print(t)
print(type(t))
 # here single value cannot taken as a tuple it will takes it as a integer......


t=(10,)
print(t)
print(type(t))
# here by putting , comma with single value then it will be a tuple......


# creation of tuple with different data items:
t=(10,"ram",8.2,20,False)
print(t)
print(type(t))

# creation of tuple  without using paranthesis:
t=10,20,"ram",8.2,60
print(t)
print(type(t))


# convertion of list elements to tuple elements by using tuple function:
l=[10,20,30,40,50]
t=tuple(l)
print(t)
print(l)

# # characterstics of tuple:
# tuple is immutable in nature
# tuple maintaining order
#tuple can hold different data items
#  duplicate elements are allowed
# () paranthesis is optional but it is recommended
# tuple supports both positive and negative index


 # we can acess the tuple elements using positive inedx, negative index, also using slicing....
t=(10,20,"ram",5.6,30)
print(t)
print(type(t))

# creation of tuple using string:
a="welcome to HIETECH SOLUTIONS"
print(a)
t=tuple(a)
print(t)

# Accessing elements by using nested tuple:

print(t)
print(t[0])
print(t[1])
print(t[3][0])

print(t[4] [2])

# modifying tuple elements:
t=(10,20,30,"poojitha")
print(t)
t[2]=98
# print(t)  # Here it shows an error because in tuple we cannot modify the elements, tuple is immutable

x=("apple","banana","cherry")

# We can also repeat the elements in a tuple for a given number of times using the * operator.
# Both + and * operations result in a new tuple.'''
