'''
Duck typing is to determine if an object is suitable for a purpose by checking for the presence of certain methods and properties rather than objects actual type.

#  If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck,and quacks like a duck,then it probbably is a duck...
#  which simply means it doesnt matter it is duck or not if the behaviour of the bird match with the duck then it is a duck....
#Example
class A:
    def m1(self):
        print('A-m1')
class B:
    def m1(self):
        print('B-m1')
class C:
    def m1(self):
        print('C-m1')
        
def search(x):
    x.m1()

a=A()
search(a)

b=B()
search(b)

#Example
class Duck:
    def swim(self):
        print("Duck is swimming")
    
    def fly(self):
        print("Duck is Flying")
class Whale:
    def swim(self):
        print("Whale is Swimming")
